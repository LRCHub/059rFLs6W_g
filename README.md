# Clairo – Thank You

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Sometimes I wonder
if you were the one
When you opened the door,
cracked me wide open
Something about it
doesn't sit right with me
And how could it be?
When I walk away,
it always comes in threes
We don't get on,
can't make you laugh,
personality
But I don't invest the way
I'd prefer
Someone to in me
I really hate to admit it
I put my pride on the line
'Cause when I met you, I knew it
I'd thank you for your time
I'd thank you for your time
Thank you for the time
Sometimes I want somebody
to see me
How you opened my doors
and left them wide open
Why doesn't this happen
more naturally?
If I tried, maybe
When you're lonely,
you'll just do anything
To drink it all up,
the feeling, it's the memory
That's when it all aligns,
I can really see
What you meant to me
I really hate to admit it
I put my pride on the line
'Cause when I met you, I knew it
I'd thank you for your time
I'd thank you for your time
Thank you for the time
All because of you
All because of you
I really hate to admit it
I put my pride on the line
'Cause when I met you, I knew it
I'd thank you for your time
I'd thank you for your time
Thank you for the time
